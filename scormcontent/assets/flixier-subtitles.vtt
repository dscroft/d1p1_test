00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:04.179
John lives here and works here,

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:08.689
which means that he has to move across the city to get to work.

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:11.369
But life isn't just work.

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:14.010
John has more things to get done during the day.

00:00:14.079 --> 00:00:17.510
Wouldn't it be great if this daily commute could be integrated?

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.569
So John wouldn't have to connect to each point separately paying.

00:00:21.579 --> 00:00:22.459
For example,

00:00:22.469 --> 00:00:24.239
just one mobility bill.

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:29.370
That's where we come in A to B connects companies to public

00:00:29.379 --> 00:00:34.049
authorities providing solutions for mobility payments and operations,

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:38.380
ensuring that mobility networks are open to everyone including

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:41.740
towing with manual and electronic payments,

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:44.409
using vehicle beacons or mobile apps,

00:00:45.659 --> 00:00:50.029
parking all the way from accessing the parks to easy payments,

00:00:50.439 --> 00:00:51.729
vehicle sharing,

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:54.740
whether it is a car trip or a last mile,

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:55.619
bike ride,

00:00:55.869 --> 00:00:59.979
drive throughs from food places to groceries and drug stores,

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:03.490
fueling with effortless tag payments,

00:01:03.939 --> 00:01:07.440
public transport which means linking trains,

00:01:07.449 --> 00:01:08.290
ferries,

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:09.089
taxis,

00:01:09.099 --> 00:01:10.080
subways,

00:01:10.089 --> 00:01:11.059
buses,

00:01:11.069 --> 00:01:12.069
you name it.

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.959
Every mobility operator is invited to play its part along with the

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:20.330
organizations that manage the road and city traffic,

00:01:20.389 --> 00:01:25.099
ensuring that all this flow flows this

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:29.940
way traveling and commuting becomes a seamless mobility experience for

00:01:29.949 --> 00:01:34.839
John and everybody else because it's not just about going from A to

00:01:34.849 --> 00:01:35.269
B,

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:37.540
it's about transforming the ride,

00:01:37.809 --> 00:01:39.139
making it easier,

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:40.019
safer,

00:01:40.029 --> 00:01:42.209
more sustainable and fulfilling.

00:01:42.599 --> 00:01:44.349
And when John gets to the end,

00:01:44.459 --> 00:01:45.870
it's more than A B,

00:01:45.879 --> 00:01:50.680
it's A beyond A to B mobility

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:51.410
beyond.
