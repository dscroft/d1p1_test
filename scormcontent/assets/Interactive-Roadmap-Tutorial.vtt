00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.653
Hello and welcome to this tutorial

00:00:04.653 --> 00:00:08.615
on the UK Connected
and Automated Mobility Roadmap to 2030.

00:00:08.692 --> 00:00:10.769
CAM creators update

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:13.076
In this tutorial,
I'll explain how to use the roadmap

00:00:13.076 --> 00:00:16.076
outlining some of the key features
along the way.

00:00:16.307 --> 00:00:19.884
As we can see, we're in the home view here
and we've got our toolbar along the left

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.461
through which we can go
to the different views of the roadmap.

00:00:23.538 --> 00:00:26.500
Let's jump into the high level overview.

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:29.076
Now, this is the most condensed
version of the roadmap providing

00:00:29.076 --> 00:00:33.423
an overview of the key activities
that need to happen between now and 2030.

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:36.461
We've got our themes and streams
of the roadmap along the left here,

00:00:36.461 --> 00:00:40.269
and we've got a timeline between now
and 2030.

00:00:40.346 --> 00:00:43.846
Now, in the body of the view
here, we've got our one page groups

00:00:43.923 --> 00:00:46.769
and these represent collections
of related milestones.

00:00:46.769 --> 00:00:50.307
And to see these milestones, all we need
to do is click on one of these groups

00:00:50.384 --> 00:00:53.269
and the related milestones will open here

00:00:53.346 --> 00:00:54.269
to return back to The View.

00:00:54.269 --> 00:00:57.576
All I need to do
is just click back on this icon.

00:00:57.653 --> 00:01:00.846
Now let's jump into the full roadmap
to 2030 view,

00:01:00.923 --> 00:01:03.923
and this displays
all of the milestones of the roadmap.

00:01:04.076 --> 00:01:06.769
We've got the same structure
as the high level overview with our themes

00:01:06.769 --> 00:01:10.461
and streams on the left and
also our timeline along the bottom here.

00:01:10.538 --> 00:01:14.576
And we've got a scrollable view here.

00:01:14.653 --> 00:01:17.884
And one of the things that you'll notice
is the colors

00:01:17.884 --> 00:01:20.884
over in this view,
we've got all red, amber and green

00:01:20.884 --> 00:01:26.269
rag progress statuses is what these,
these colors represent.

00:01:26.269 --> 00:01:31.192
So they represent the progress
of these activities, these milestones.

00:01:31.192 --> 00:01:34.807
And you'll see the key for those colors
in the top here.

00:01:34.884 --> 00:01:35.884
Now, there are a number of ways

00:01:35.884 --> 00:01:39.884
to reduce activities down to those
that are most relevant.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.923
One of the first things we can do
is click on an orienting milestone.

00:01:44.115 --> 00:01:47.846
So let's just find this one here
so we can click on this one here.

00:01:47.846 --> 00:01:50.576
This one is called Defined Communications
for new schemes.

00:01:50.576 --> 00:01:53.884
And by clicking on this one,
we can see the related milestones

00:01:53.884 --> 00:01:56.769
and also the relationships that

00:01:56.846 --> 00:01:59.692
One of the other
ways that we can reduce down activities.

00:01:59.692 --> 00:02:02.730
So as part of this new update,
we've got this search functionality here

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:05.692
which searches across the name
and description information

00:02:05.692 --> 00:02:06.846
of these milestones.

00:02:06.846 --> 00:02:09.653
So let's say
I'm interested in data formats.

00:02:09.653 --> 00:02:11.461
As you see

00:02:11.461 --> 00:02:13.846
as Iâ€™m typing,
the milestones will reduce down

00:02:13.846 --> 00:02:16.769
and let's go through to date formats.

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:18.884
And now this is the milestone
that I'm interested in.

00:02:18.884 --> 00:02:21.153
So I want to find out
more about this milestone.

00:02:21.153 --> 00:02:24.423
So what I need to do is right
click, click, open Item

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:28.269
and the global panel for this
milestone will open here.

00:02:28.346 --> 00:02:30.846
And the first panel
you see is an attributes

00:02:30.846 --> 00:02:33.884
panel which will provide some information
about this milestone.

00:02:33.884 --> 00:02:38.461
So we've got an ID description, details
of themed stream start and end dates.

00:02:38.538 --> 00:02:42.384
We've got the panel for relationships
for this milestone and also panel for

00:02:42.384 --> 00:02:43.923
is text.

00:02:44.038 --> 00:02:45.576
Now as part of the new

00:02:45.576 --> 00:02:49.538
update, we've got two new panels here,
the first of which is this progress panel.

00:02:49.538 --> 00:02:53.576
So we've got an overall ranked progress
status of green in progress

00:02:53.576 --> 00:02:55.076
to complete on time.

00:02:55.076 --> 00:02:58.076
And then we've got a selection
of underlying evidence points

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:03.769
that underlie that overall rank
progress status so that you can explore.

00:03:03.846 --> 00:03:06.538
Now the second new panel here
is this contributions panel,

00:03:06.538 --> 00:03:11.769
which details those active contributions
towards the delivery of this activity

00:03:11.846 --> 00:03:16.038
and also details
those expressions of future interest

00:03:16.115 --> 00:03:18.346
from organisations
that are keen to get involved

00:03:18.346 --> 00:03:21.346
in the delivery of this activity
going forward.

00:03:21.576 --> 00:03:22.692
And here we really begin

00:03:22.692 --> 00:03:26.500
to see where we can identify
opportunities is within the roadmap.

00:03:26.653 --> 00:03:29.038
We can we can find out
what people are already contributing.

00:03:29.038 --> 00:03:30.846
We can find out information
through the links,

00:03:30.846 --> 00:03:33.576
we can find out more through the website,
and we can also get in touch

00:03:33.576 --> 00:03:38.307
by the contact information that we can
find out who's who's already involved

00:03:38.384 --> 00:03:40.269
and how in what capacity.

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:42.230
And we can also find out
those organisations

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:43.884
who are keen to get involved as well.

00:03:43.884 --> 00:03:49.038
And we've got, again, websites and contact
information that we can really start

00:03:49.038 --> 00:03:53.076
to identify opportunities
through this panel.

00:03:53.153 --> 00:03:54.500
Now, there are some other ways

00:03:54.500 --> 00:04:00.923
to reduce down to relevant activities here
so we can return back to the view here

00:04:01.192 --> 00:04:03.923
if we want to reduce down
to a particular stream of interest,

00:04:03.923 --> 00:04:07.730
let's say licensing, and you see
if we can click on this panel here

00:04:07.807 --> 00:04:10.538
and the roadmap will reduce down to only

00:04:10.538 --> 00:04:13.538
those activities within this stream.

00:04:13.538 --> 00:04:16.692
Now let's return back to the view

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:21.346
now one of the key features with
this update is the update to the tagging.

00:04:21.423 --> 00:04:22.153
So we'll see.

00:04:22.153 --> 00:04:25.115
There's a blue overlay here
that points to this tagging module

00:04:25.115 --> 00:04:27.538
and I'm just going to exit
that here for now.

00:04:27.538 --> 00:04:29.346
And we've got some groups here
we could all tag.

00:04:29.346 --> 00:04:33.807
So over 60 new tags have been mapped
across the roadmap data.

00:04:33.807 --> 00:04:35.307
As part of this release.

00:04:35.307 --> 00:04:38.038
We've got two golden threads
that were featured in the version

00:04:38.038 --> 00:04:40.923
one release of the roadmap
and then we've also got tags for

00:04:40.923 --> 00:04:45.423
can create to organisations
that have been involved in this update.

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:49.807
So we can expand these groups
by clicking on the arrow here.

00:04:49.884 --> 00:04:53.269
Let's jump in and give a bit of a demo
as to how these work.

00:04:53.346 --> 00:04:56.807
So let's say I want to find out about data
related activity.

00:04:56.884 --> 00:04:58.153
Within this view.

00:04:58.153 --> 00:05:02.846
I can click on data here and the view
will reduce down to those activities.

00:05:02.923 --> 00:05:04.230
So reduce

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:09.307
down to those activities
related to data here,

00:05:09.384 --> 00:05:11.884
but we can also do that
across multiple tags.

00:05:11.884 --> 00:05:14.884
So we can do that with safety as well.

00:05:14.884 --> 00:05:16.538
So let's keep data on.

00:05:16.538 --> 00:05:18.615
We can also click safety there.

00:05:18.615 --> 00:05:21.076
And at the moment we've got

00:05:21.076 --> 00:05:24.000
data or safety,
but we can also do data around safety.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000
So where those tags overlap,

00:05:27.038 --> 00:05:30.038
we can also do this across different
tagging groups.

00:05:30.192 --> 00:05:35.576
So let's say I want to find out
where the National Physical Laboratory

00:05:35.653 --> 00:05:38.576
are involved in sensors.

00:05:38.576 --> 00:05:41.038
Let's find that.

00:05:41.038 --> 00:05:43.653
So we've got all our toggle on and there

00:05:43.653 --> 00:05:48.269
so this is what the National Physical
Laboratory have contributed

00:05:48.346 --> 00:05:51.346
to contribute the data
towards those activities

00:05:51.346 --> 00:05:55.461
where they are contributing
to activity in sensors there.

00:05:55.538 --> 00:06:00.192
Now let's return
back to the full road map view here

00:06:00.269 --> 00:06:02.615
and let's jump to the next view.

00:06:02.615 --> 00:06:07.307
So this is our CAM created view
for these organisations.

00:06:07.307 --> 00:06:10.192
These can create two organisations that

00:06:10.192 --> 00:06:12.730
are involved in this release.

00:06:12.730 --> 00:06:15.730
So as you can see, you can scroll down
and you can see all the organisations

00:06:15.807 --> 00:06:19.115
that are involved here,
and we can click on an organisation

00:06:19.115 --> 00:06:22.538
to open up the global panel
and you'll find some information

00:06:22.615 --> 00:06:23.500
about the organisation.

00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:25.192
It's name and description.

00:06:25.653 --> 00:06:29.269
Also some contacts, information, website,
an email address

00:06:29.346 --> 00:06:32.846
and they also panel here to point
you back to the previous view to find out

00:06:32.846 --> 00:06:36.538
where that organisation is involved.

00:06:36.615 --> 00:06:37.538
Now, with the help

00:06:37.538 --> 00:06:42.538
of the powerful tagging functionality
that comes with this update, you can now

00:06:42.538 --> 00:06:46.038
see which organisations are involved
in which topics across the roadmap.

00:06:46.115 --> 00:06:49.769
So let's say I want to find out who's
involved in standards related activity.

00:06:49.769 --> 00:06:52.769
I can click on Standard here
and it will reduce down.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:54.730
We can also do that over multiple tags.

00:06:54.730 --> 00:06:57.192
So standards and communications.

00:06:57.192 --> 00:07:00.153
Oh, let's flip that over to all.

00:07:00.153 --> 00:07:01.769
So we've got communications

00:07:01.769 --> 00:07:05.615
and standards over there and
then we can do that for four and as well.

00:07:05.730 --> 00:07:13.384
And that will reduce those
organisations down to such.

00:07:13.461 --> 00:07:17.346
Now let's jump to this last few here.

00:07:17.423 --> 00:07:21.230
So maybe you've got some suggestions
for new activities within the roadmap.

00:07:21.461 --> 00:07:23.500
And if we click on this button here,

00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:26.846
this will open up a new form
where you can propose activities

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.423
for the roadmap so it can provide a name
for your proposed activity.

00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:33.307
You can suggest a stream or where

00:07:33.307 --> 00:07:36.615
it should sit under a stream or where
it should sit under a one page, a group.

00:07:36.615 --> 00:07:38.692
If you want to be more specific,

00:07:38.692 --> 00:07:42.038
also provide a description
of your activity, start and end date.

00:07:42.115 --> 00:07:45.500
What this activity would depend upon
which activity is already

00:07:45.500 --> 00:07:49.115
existing within the roadmap
and what this activity would enable.

00:07:49.269 --> 00:07:53.846
And for these fields here, we need
to provide the IDs of those activities.

00:07:53.846 --> 00:07:57.615
So if you rewind the video, we can
you can see in the global panel

00:07:57.615 --> 00:08:00.346
where to find the external
IP that you need to quote.

00:08:00.346 --> 00:08:03.653
And in this last field here,
we can provide some

00:08:03.730 --> 00:08:07.076
some detail, some justification
as to why you think this activity

00:08:07.153 --> 00:08:08.500
should be added to the roadmap.

00:08:08.500 --> 00:08:11.538
Maybe there's a particular gap
you think this activity would address

00:08:11.730 --> 00:08:14.615
or maybe you think it should replace
another activity.

00:08:14.615 --> 00:08:17.807
We'd love to hear
your thoughts around that.

00:08:17.884 --> 00:08:20.384
So we're turning back to The View here.

00:08:20.384 --> 00:08:24.615
Perhaps you'd like to become a CAM Creator,
as these organisations

00:08:24.692 --> 00:08:27.230
have that I've just showcased there.

00:08:27.230 --> 00:08:30.230
So if we click here,
this will take us through to our website

00:08:30.230 --> 00:08:33.076
where you can fill in the form
to become a CAM Creator.

00:08:33.076 --> 00:08:35.807
We've got some general information,
questions about your organisation

00:08:35.807 --> 00:08:40.269
and then some data collection, questions
about the roadmap activities themselves.

00:08:40.269 --> 00:08:45.500
And we've got some examples there
to help you to fill in the form.

00:08:45.576 --> 00:08:47.269
And if you've got any other feedback
or questions,

00:08:47.269 --> 00:08:52.115
please do drop us
an email at info@zenzic.io

00:08:52.192 --> 00:08:54.576
and if you've spotted a mistake as well,

00:08:54.576 --> 00:08:56.884
please drop us an email as well.

00:08:56.884 --> 00:08:59.269
We'd love to hear from you.

00:08:59.269 --> 00:09:01.076
Thank you very much
for watching this tutorial.
