00:00:02.615 --> 00:00:04.500
It's not fun to have your two ton

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.500
SUV's brakes hacked
just as you're parked in front of a ditch.

00:00:08.576 --> 00:00:10.153
Okay, hold on tight. Hold on.

00:00:10.153 --> 00:00:14.538
Because that's what I've learned
from Charlie Miller and Chris Valasek.

00:00:14.615 --> 00:00:18.076
A pair of hackers who have spent the last
year developing a piece of software

00:00:18.076 --> 00:00:22.153
that can wirelessly sabotage
this 2014 Jeep Cherokee.

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:23.884
It hasn't been altered in any way.

00:00:23.884 --> 00:00:25.807
There are no devices attached to it.

00:00:25.807 --> 00:00:28.692
But like many thousands of jeeps
around the world,

00:00:28.692 --> 00:00:31.500
it can be remotely
hacked over the Internet

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.846
through a cellular connection
to its entertainment system

00:00:33.846 --> 00:00:34.576
that would allow someone

00:00:34.576 --> 00:00:38.538
to take over its steering,
its transmission and even its brakes

00:00:38.615 --> 00:00:41.500
to demonstrate that, I'm
going to act as today's crash test

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:44.500
dummy and drive it on the highway here
in Saint Louis.

00:00:44.576 --> 00:00:49.153
While Charlie and Chris hijack its digital
systems from Charlie's house miles away.

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.076
They wouldn't tell me what they had plans,

00:00:51.076 --> 00:00:53.653
but they assured me that it wouldn't
be anything life threatening.

00:00:53.653 --> 00:00:56.038
Remember, Andy, no matter what happens.

00:00:56.038 --> 00:00:57.230
Don't panic.

00:00:57.230 --> 00:00:58.769
It's not the first time I've driven a car

00:00:58.769 --> 00:01:01.384
while it's being attacked
by these two hackers.

00:01:01.384 --> 00:01:05.423
But in 2013, they were in the backseat
and their laptops were wired

00:01:05.423 --> 00:01:08.461
into the vehicle
through a port in its back.

00:01:08.538 --> 00:01:09.230
Now they're sending the

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:12.884
same sort of attacks remotely,
and I have no idea what they might do.

00:01:13.038 --> 00:01:15.076
He's going as fast as I've seen them. So.

00:01:15.076 --> 00:01:16.807
So first, we're going to turn the fan on.

00:01:16.807 --> 00:01:21.500
Then let's turn the fan
on, see if even notices

00:01:21.576 --> 00:01:22.615
are that.

00:01:22.615 --> 00:01:26.192
Something just turned on all the fans
and AC and stuff.

00:01:26.346 --> 00:01:28.192
I didn't do that.

00:01:28.192 --> 00:01:29.730
The trick started small.

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:31.000
Oh, my God.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.192
There was a picture of Charlie
and Chris in tracksuits

00:01:34.192 --> 00:01:36.192
that just appeared on the dashboard.

00:01:36.192 --> 00:01:40.192
But as I drove down the interstate,
things started getting unpleasant

00:01:40.269 --> 00:01:49.307
and very loud.

00:01:49.384 --> 00:01:51.269
You can't turn it down.

00:01:51.269 --> 00:01:52.653
This is such a fun video.

00:01:52.653 --> 00:01:54.884
You look. At me now they're.

00:01:54.884 --> 00:01:57.884
Saying the air conditioning is blasting.

00:01:58.192 --> 00:02:04.500
The music is flashing, and I can't see
anything because of the windshield wiper.

00:02:04.576 --> 00:02:06.192
I've got to do it.

00:02:06.192 --> 00:02:08.076
Do it. Kill the engine.

00:02:08.076 --> 00:02:10.461
So we're killing the engine right now.

00:02:10.461 --> 00:02:13.461
So this is part of the

00:02:13.615 --> 00:02:15.115
story.

00:02:15.115 --> 00:02:16.653
Actually,

00:02:16.653 --> 00:02:20.192
I stomped on the gas,
but the jeep slowed to a crawl

00:02:20.269 --> 00:02:23.269
at 43 miles an hour, not going out.

00:02:23.423 --> 00:02:26.538
I turned on my hazard lights,
but I was still stuck in the right lane

00:02:26.538 --> 00:02:28.000
with no shoulder to escape on.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.153
Two guys stuck on the highway.

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:33.807
I think he's panicking.

00:02:33.807 --> 00:02:35.269
He's like, You'll hear us in that radio.

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:37.730
It's so loud.

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:42.038
Guys, I need to accelerator to work to get

00:02:42.076 --> 00:02:43.076
the accelerator lower.

00:02:43.076 --> 00:02:45.192
It won't work.

00:02:45.192 --> 00:02:47.884
You're doing this is dangerous.

00:02:47.884 --> 00:02:49.230
I need to move.

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:51.769
You got to turn the car off.

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:52.115
Okay.

00:02:52.115 --> 00:02:57.461
Now you should be good to go.

00:02:57.538 --> 00:02:58.615
I drove by.

00:02:58.615 --> 00:03:02.115
All right, I'm going to pull over
because I have PTSD.

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:03.615
Charlie and Chris have only tested

00:03:03.615 --> 00:03:06.615
the full range of their attacks
on a Jeep Cherokee,

00:03:06.653 --> 00:03:10.115
but they say that hundreds of thousands
of late model Chrysler vehicles

00:03:10.153 --> 00:03:13.076
may be vulnerable
through a feature called Uconnect,

00:03:13.076 --> 00:03:16.884
an Internet connected computer
in the dashboard known as its head unit.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.884
These cars had units expose a particular
service that probably they didn't want to.

00:03:22.038 --> 00:03:25.730
It lets you do things like query it
for information like the GPS

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:28.807
or the van or all sorts of things,
but it also lets you just run commands.

00:03:28.846 --> 00:03:32.153
So you have to first break into the car
remotely over the cell network

00:03:32.153 --> 00:03:33.576
and then move laterally.

00:03:33.576 --> 00:03:35.730
If you want to do things
like send canned messages.

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:37.846
And those are the messages that we can use

00:03:37.846 --> 00:03:41.269
to control things like steering
or the windshield wipers or braking.

00:03:41.346 --> 00:03:42.576
They plan to release a portion

00:03:42.576 --> 00:03:46.884
of their exploit code at the annual Black
Hat Hacker conference next month.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.461
They've also alerted Chrysler,
which is issuing a security patch,

00:03:50.538 --> 00:03:54.038
but they say a lot more needs to be done
to protect the new generation of cars

00:03:54.115 --> 00:03:57.653
that are increasingly connected
to the Internet and potentially hackable.

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:00.576
You guys basically brought this car
to a standstill

00:04:00.576 --> 00:04:04.423
while I was driving on the highway,
which I may never forgive you for.

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:07.192
And that was just like an experiment.

00:04:07.192 --> 00:04:09.230
What do you think
is the worst case scenario?

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:10.461
We wanted to point out,

00:04:10.461 --> 00:04:14.653
you know, to show that this attack is
has serious consequences for this vehicle.

00:04:14.653 --> 00:04:19.769
And so we did, you know, attack you,
but we did it in a safe way as we could.

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:21.076
So we didn't want to get hurt.

00:04:21.076 --> 00:04:24.807
Obviously, that's why we're working
is to make sure that we figure out

00:04:24.807 --> 00:04:27.576
vulnerabilities, weaknesses,
get them fixed.

00:04:27.576 --> 00:04:30.269
We're only we're only two guys
with one car, Right?

00:04:30.269 --> 00:04:33.653
So, you know, we can't look at every car
and we want to release this information

00:04:33.653 --> 00:04:36.846
because more people like us
need to be focused on this problem.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000
After their stunt on the highway,

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.000
Chris and Charlie still wanted to show me
a couple of other tricks.

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:43.346
Below a certain speed,

00:04:43.346 --> 00:04:46.346
they can control the jeep steering
as long as it's in reverse.

00:04:46.461 --> 00:04:52.653
Puppets, locks, mess with the speedometer
and of course, disable the brakes.

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:53.692
Okay, hold on tight.

00:04:53.692 --> 00:04:55.038
Hold on.

00:04:55.038 --> 00:04:57.038
Oh, is that getting out of that?

00:04:57.038 --> 00:04:57.576
I think so.

00:04:57.576 --> 00:05:00.846
However,
we're going to do it. Some caution.

00:05:03.307 --> 00:05:04.692
That's how you drive in the Midwest.

00:05:04.692 --> 00:05:06.192
New Yorkers know how to do that.
