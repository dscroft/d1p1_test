00:00:02.846 --> 00:00:05.846
Last Friday, the EPA
announced that some Volkswagen Audi cars

00:00:05.846 --> 00:00:10.153
made between 2009 and this year
were using a so-called defeat device

00:00:10.153 --> 00:00:13.153
to get around emissions
laws designed to keep the air clean.

00:00:13.346 --> 00:00:15.884
But what does that mean exactly?

00:00:15.884 --> 00:00:19.153
Well, modern cars have dozens of computers
inside them

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:20.730
and some of those computers
help coordinate

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:23.730
the functions of the engine
for optimum performance while making sure

00:00:23.807 --> 00:00:26.576
that there isn't too much garbage
coming out of the exhaust pipe.

00:00:26.576 --> 00:00:29.461
They've actually been working this way
for several decades now.

00:00:29.461 --> 00:00:33.461
Basically, every part of a modern car's
engine has a sensor or a controller on it,

00:00:33.538 --> 00:00:36.653
and these computers are reading in data
thousands of times per second,

00:00:36.884 --> 00:00:40.384
making adjustments like the ratio of fuel
to air that's going into the cylinders.

00:00:40.576 --> 00:00:43.000
These cheating Volkswagen
and Audi models are diesels.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.384
And diesels have one more really important
computer controlled parameter,

00:00:46.461 --> 00:00:49.423
which is the amount of unburned fuel
going into the exhaust.

00:00:49.423 --> 00:00:50.538
Now, that sounds bad.

00:00:50.538 --> 00:00:54.000
Doesn't sound like you would want unburned
fuel going into the exhaust,

00:00:54.076 --> 00:00:57.038
but in the case of a diesel,
you have something called a NOx trap,

00:00:57.038 --> 00:01:01.153
which is a device that absorbs and traps
nitrogen oxides that are pollutants

00:01:01.153 --> 00:01:03.230
that would otherwise
go into the atmosphere.

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:07.192
And the effect of that NOx trap
is enhanced with unburned fuel.

00:01:07.269 --> 00:01:10.769
So a defeat device is a special program
inside these computers that can make

00:01:10.769 --> 00:01:13.769
it look like the car meets emission
standards, even when it doesn't.

00:01:13.807 --> 00:01:15.384
Volkswagen had a problem on its hands.

00:01:15.384 --> 00:01:18.269
Its diesel engines were known
for getting great fuel economy.

00:01:18.269 --> 00:01:21.615
But the NOx trap only works
well when more fuel is being used.

00:01:21.692 --> 00:01:24.653
So the car would detect
using this defeat device.

00:01:24.653 --> 00:01:26.846
When it was getting an emissions test,

00:01:26.846 --> 00:01:29.192
it would use more fuel,
make the NOx trap work.

00:01:29.192 --> 00:01:31.038
Well, emissions would be fine.

00:01:31.038 --> 00:01:35.346
But then you get on the road, the device
turns off, you're burning less fuel,

00:01:35.346 --> 00:01:38.346
but you're putting as much as 40 times
more pollutants into the atmosphere.

00:01:38.576 --> 00:01:39.807
But how the heck did the car know

00:01:39.807 --> 00:01:41.846
that it was being tested
for emissions compliance?

00:01:41.846 --> 00:01:45.384
The EPA says it was a sophisticated system
that checked things like steering wheel

00:01:45.384 --> 00:01:49.730
position, speed, how long the engine was
on, and even the atmospheric pressure.

00:01:49.846 --> 00:01:51.769
In other words,
there was no way this was accidental

00:01:51.769 --> 00:01:54.000
because the software was designed
very carefully

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.807
to detect an official emissions test.

00:01:55.807 --> 00:01:57.538
That's a pretty serious deception,
and that's

00:01:57.538 --> 00:01:59.576
why Volkswagen is in such serious trouble.

00:01:59.576 --> 00:02:02.615
In fact, their CEO, Martin Vinter
Cohen, just stepped down.

00:02:02.769 --> 00:02:03.807
So what happens next?

00:02:03.807 --> 00:02:06.000
Well,
if you own one of the half million diesel

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.615
Jetta beetles
golfs, PASSATS or Audi A3 is affected.

00:02:09.692 --> 00:02:12.192
The good news is that
your car is still safe to drive.

00:02:12.192 --> 00:02:14.615
You don't have to put it away
until Volkswagen issues a recall.

00:02:14.615 --> 00:02:15.884
But at some point, they're probably going

00:02:15.884 --> 00:02:18.384
to have to update the software
inside your car.

00:02:18.384 --> 00:02:21.115
And when that happens,
you might get fewer miles per game.

00:02:21.115 --> 00:02:23.615
Lawyers are already gearing up
for class action lawsuits,

00:02:23.615 --> 00:02:26.615
so owners might get compensated
at some point in the future.

00:02:26.615 --> 00:02:28.269
But that's not
going to happen anytime soon.
