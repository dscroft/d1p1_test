00:00:01.153 --> 00:00:03.192
Electrification in vehicles

00:00:03.192 --> 00:00:06.192
exemplified by electric and hybrid models

00:00:06.346 --> 00:00:09.076
offers efficiency, lower costs,

00:00:09.076 --> 00:00:12.884
instant torque
and reduced environmental impacts.

00:00:13.038 --> 00:00:15.576
Electric propulsion precision facilitates

00:00:15.576 --> 00:00:18.884
seamless integration
with Automated Driving Systems.

00:00:18.884 --> 00:00:23.538
ADS, allowing for finer control
of vehicle movements.

00:00:23.615 --> 00:00:27.730
Additionally,
regenerative braking, quality operation

00:00:27.846 --> 00:00:33.000
and modular design contribute
to an enhanced driving experience.

00:00:33.076 --> 00:00:34.884
The combination of electric

00:00:34.884 --> 00:00:38.153
drive trains and automated capabilities

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:42.500
promises a revolutionary shift
in transportation,

00:00:42.576 --> 00:00:46.846
promoting sustainability
and advanced vehicle dynamics.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.346
However, challenges
such as charging infrastructure

00:00:51.423 --> 00:00:55.115
and environmental considerations
in battery production

00:00:55.115 --> 00:00:58.884
must be addressed for the full realization
of these benefits.
