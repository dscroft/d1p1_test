00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:04.109
More companies are trying to
bring self driving cars to the

b4314f73-cde2-484c-94ed-361bbe58be60-1
00:00:04.109 --> 00:00:07.591
masses than ever before. Yet a
truly autonomous vehicle still

b4314f73-cde2-484c-94ed-361bbe58be60-2
00:00:07.591 --> 00:00:11.298
doesn't exist and it's not clear
if or when our driverless future

b4314f73-cde2-484c-94ed-361bbe58be60-3
00:00:11.298 --> 00:00:14.331
will arrive. Proponents like
Elon Musk have touted an

b4314f73-cde2-484c-94ed-361bbe58be60-4
00:00:14.331 --> 00:00:17.813
aggressive timeline but missed
their goals, and others in the

b4314f73-cde2-484c-94ed-361bbe58be60-5
00:00:17.813 --> 00:00:21.015
industry have also missed
projections. Well, our goal is

b4314f73-cde2-484c-94ed-361bbe58be60-6
00:00:21.015 --> 00:00:24.721
to deploy these vehicles in 2019
so you'll have the option to not

b4314f73-cde2-484c-94ed-361bbe58be60-7
00:00:24.721 --> 00:00:28.091
drive. It's not happening in
2020, it's happening today. We

b4314f73-cde2-484c-94ed-361bbe58be60-8
00:00:28.091 --> 00:00:31.405
wanted to check in. Where
exactly are we with self driving

b4314f73-cde2-484c-94ed-361bbe58be60-9
00:00:31.405 --> 00:00:31.630
cars

c8f9f928-8a7d-44af-80e6-174296197c62-0
00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:34.360
and wind? Can we expect them to
be part of our daily lives?

1e31f1ba-873e-40d3-bacc-fe6da3969392-0
00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.394
The current state of driverless
cars is very interesting because

1e31f1ba-873e-40d3-bacc-fe6da3969392-1
00:00:45.394 --> 00:00:48.581
we've passed what people refer
to as peak hype and we've

1e31f1ba-873e-40d3-bacc-fe6da3969392-2
00:00:48.581 --> 00:00:51.600
entered what's called the
through of disillusionment,

1e31f1ba-873e-40d3-bacc-fe6da3969392-3
00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.010
which is even people within the
industry are saying, Gee, it

1e31f1ba-873e-40d3-bacc-fe6da3969392-4
00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:58.029
turns out this is a lot harder
than we thought. We're

1e31f1ba-873e-40d3-bacc-fe6da3969392-5
00:00:58.029 --> 00:01:01.440
definitely not anywhere near as
far along as a lot of people

1e31f1ba-873e-40d3-bacc-fe6da3969392-6
00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.962
thought we would be three years
ago, but I think over the last

1e31f1ba-873e-40d3-bacc-fe6da3969392-7
00:01:04.962 --> 00:01:05.409
18 to 24

816fc538-31f7-46c1-b2d8-56dd417b043a-0
00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:09.115
months there's been, you know, a
real injection of reality. There

816fc538-31f7-46c1-b2d8-56dd417b043a-1
00:01:09.115 --> 00:01:12.695
was a sense maybe a year or two
ago that ohh, our algorithms are

816fc538-31f7-46c1-b2d8-56dd417b043a-2
00:01:12.695 --> 00:01:15.945
so good, we're ready to launch,
we're gonna launch drivers

816fc538-31f7-46c1-b2d8-56dd417b043a-3
00:01:15.945 --> 00:01:19.195
guides and any minute and then
obviously there's been this

816fc538-31f7-46c1-b2d8-56dd417b043a-4
00:01:19.195 --> 00:01:22.334
setbacks of people getting
killed or accidents happening

816fc538-31f7-46c1-b2d8-56dd417b043a-5
00:01:22.334 --> 00:01:25.364
and now we're a lot more
cautious. Several big players

816fc538-31f7-46c1-b2d8-56dd417b043a-6
00:01:25.364 --> 00:01:28.834
have begun to walk back their
predictions on how soon we could

816fc538-31f7-46c1-b2d8-56dd417b043a-7
00:01:28.834 --> 00:01:31.973
see this technology. Even
Waymo's chief external officer

816fc538-31f7-46c1-b2d8-56dd417b043a-8
00:01:31.973 --> 00:01:35.443
admitted that the hype around
its self driving cars has become

816fc538-31f7-46c1-b2d8-56dd417b043a-9
00:01:35.443 --> 00:01:36.159
unmanageable.

3065e5e2-5f81-4a83-b82d-8e73a78cfaf1-0
00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:39.485
The technology has come a long
way, but there's still a lot of

3065e5e2-5f81-4a83-b82d-8e73a78cfaf1-1
00:01:39.485 --> 00:01:42.578
work to be done. There's the
perception, which is, you know,

3065e5e2-5f81-4a83-b82d-8e73a78cfaf1-2
00:01:42.578 --> 00:01:45.722
using the sensors to figure out
what's around the vehicle and

3065e5e2-5f81-4a83-b82d-8e73a78cfaf1-3
00:01:45.722 --> 00:01:48.765
the environment around the
vehicle prediction, figuring out

3065e5e2-5f81-4a83-b82d-8e73a78cfaf1-4
00:01:48.765 --> 00:01:51.859
what those, what those road
users are going to be doing next

3065e5e2-5f81-4a83-b82d-8e73a78cfaf1-5
00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:55.054
in the next few seconds. Turns
out that the perception and and

3065e5e2-5f81-4a83-b82d-8e73a78cfaf1-6
00:01:55.054 --> 00:01:57.995
especially prediction are
really, really hard problems to

3065e5e2-5f81-4a83-b82d-8e73a78cfaf1-7
00:01:57.995 --> 00:01:58.299
solve.

7d1e0552-8282-4571-838e-4f5143d6e627-0
00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:02.316
Companies tackling self driving
today are taking two general

7d1e0552-8282-4571-838e-4f5143d6e627-1
00:02:02.316 --> 00:02:05.721
approaches. Some are building a
self driving car from the ground

7d1e0552-8282-4571-838e-4f5143d6e627-2
00:02:05.721 --> 00:02:08.865
up. Others are developing the
brains that drive the car in.

7d1e0552-8282-4571-838e-4f5143d6e627-3
00:02:08.865 --> 00:02:11.904
Early leader was Google, who
started its self-driving car

7d1e0552-8282-4571-838e-4f5143d6e627-4
00:02:11.904 --> 00:02:15.310
project in 2009 known as Waymo.
Today, the company is developing

7d1e0552-8282-4571-838e-4f5143d6e627-5
00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:18.663
hardware and software that can
function as the brains in a self

7d1e0552-8282-4571-838e-4f5143d6e627-6
00:02:18.663 --> 00:02:21.860
driving car. Aurora is taking a
similar approach. Founded in

7d1e0552-8282-4571-838e-4f5143d6e627-7
00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:25.265
2017 by early players from Uber,
Tesla and Google's self driving

7d1e0552-8282-4571-838e-4f5143d6e627-8
00:02:25.265 --> 00:02:28.462
initiatives, it's already raised
620 million in funding from

7d1e0552-8282-4571-838e-4f5143d6e627-9
00:02:28.462 --> 00:02:29.510
Amazon and other big

33411459-bac4-4f9f-b6c2-296ff0bb6210-0
00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:32.677
from investors. Rory is testing
vehicles on the road in

33411459-bac4-4f9f-b6c2-296ff0bb6210-1
00:02:32.677 --> 00:02:36.107
Pittsburgh, PA and out here in
the Bay Area. We don't yet let

33411459-bac4-4f9f-b6c2-296ff0bb6210-2
00:02:36.107 --> 00:02:39.702
the public in our cars. Our cars
are on the road. We have two of

33411459-bac4-4f9f-b6c2-296ff0bb6210-3
00:02:39.702 --> 00:02:43.187
our test operators in there. The
technology we're building can

33411459-bac4-4f9f-b6c2-296ff0bb6210-4
00:02:43.187 --> 00:02:46.671
operate from a compact electric
car to a minivan to even a big

33411459-bac4-4f9f-b6c2-296ff0bb6210-5
00:02:46.671 --> 00:02:49.880
long haul truck. Argo, AI and
Aptiv are examples of other

33411459-bac4-4f9f-b6c2-296ff0bb6210-6
00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:53.198
companies taking a similar
approach. Lyft is developing its

33411459-bac4-4f9f-b6c2-296ff0bb6210-7
00:02:53.198 --> 00:02:56.794
own self driving systems now too
and offering self-driving rides

33411459-bac4-4f9f-b6c2-296ff0bb6210-8
00:02:56.794 --> 00:02:59.560
on its app through partnerships
and select areas.

7c5963fb-7f6b-46ab-9a02-0efb743e0b5d-0
00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:03.312
After having this is too big for
just one company and one effort.

7c5963fb-7f6b-46ab-9a02-0efb743e0b5d-1
00:03:03.312 --> 00:03:06.611
And if you look at our strategy,
that is why we're working with

7c5963fb-7f6b-46ab-9a02-0efb743e0b5d-2
00:03:06.611 --> 00:03:09.807
partners on the open platform,
active and Waymo and why we're

7c5963fb-7f6b-46ab-9a02-0efb743e0b5d-3
00:03:09.807 --> 00:03:12.694
building the tech here.
Companies like Tesla, Zooks and

7c5963fb-7f6b-46ab-9a02-0efb743e0b5d-4
00:03:12.694 --> 00:03:16.045
GM with its Cruise division are
making their own vehicles aiming

7c5963fb-7f6b-46ab-9a02-0efb743e0b5d-5
00:03:16.045 --> 00:03:19.138
for self driving cars that can
operate in all environments.

7c5963fb-7f6b-46ab-9a02-0efb743e0b5d-6
00:03:19.138 --> 00:03:21.870
This is the engineering
challenge of our generation.

7c5963fb-7f6b-46ab-9a02-0efb743e0b5d-7
00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:24.963
We've raised 7 and a quarter
billion dollars of capital. We

7c5963fb-7f6b-46ab-9a02-0efb743e0b5d-8
00:03:24.963 --> 00:03:28.262
have deep integration with both
General Motors and Honda, which

7c5963fb-7f6b-46ab-9a02-0efb743e0b5d-9
00:03:28.262 --> 00:03:31.509
we think is essential to when
you're building mission critical

cd37985d-fe63-4f74-8371-98e4e8612de0-0
00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:34.599
safety systems and building
those in a way that you can

cd37985d-fe63-4f74-8371-98e4e8612de0-1
00:03:34.599 --> 00:03:37.930
deploy them at very large scale.
Crews, which was acquired by

cd37985d-fe63-4f74-8371-98e4e8612de0-2
00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:41.477
General Motors in 2016, has been
testing its fleet of vehicles in

cd37985d-fe63-4f74-8371-98e4e8612de0-3
00:03:41.477 --> 00:03:44.594
San Francisco with safety
drivers on board. To give you a

cd37985d-fe63-4f74-8371-98e4e8612de0-4
00:03:44.594 --> 00:03:47.764
sense for the magnitude of the
difference between suburban

cd37985d-fe63-4f74-8371-98e4e8612de0-5
00:03:47.764 --> 00:03:51.042
driving and what we're doing
every day on the streets of San

cd37985d-fe63-4f74-8371-98e4e8612de0-6
00:03:51.042 --> 00:03:54.428
Francisco, our cars on average
see more activity in one minute

cd37985d-fe63-4f74-8371-98e4e8612de0-7
00:03:54.428 --> 00:03:57.759
of San Francisco driving than
they see in one hour of driving

cd37985d-fe63-4f74-8371-98e4e8612de0-8
00:03:57.759 --> 00:04:01.145
in Arizona. Zooks, led by the
former Chief Strategy Officer at

cd37985d-fe63-4f74-8371-98e4e8612de0-9
00:04:01.145 --> 00:04:02.220
Intel, is working on

8febc438-38f8-4ae5-8b00-79128ab9eb8c-0
00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:04.986
creating an all-in-one
self-driving taxi system with

8febc438-38f8-4ae5-8b00-79128ab9eb8c-1
00:04:04.986 --> 00:04:07.977
plans to launch in 2020. Instead
of retrofitting cars with

8febc438-38f8-4ae5-8b00-79128ab9eb8c-2
00:04:07.977 --> 00:04:10.664
sensors and computers and
saying, hey, here's a self

8febc438-38f8-4ae5-8b00-79128ab9eb8c-3
00:04:10.664 --> 00:04:14.010
driving car, we think there's an
opportunity to create a new type

8febc438-38f8-4ae5-8b00-79128ab9eb8c-4
00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:17.103
of vehicle that from the very
beginning was designed to move

8febc438-38f8-4ae5-8b00-79128ab9eb8c-5
00:04:17.103 --> 00:04:20.145
people around autonomously.
Nissan and Tesla both have semi

8febc438-38f8-4ae5-8b00-79128ab9eb8c-6
00:04:20.145 --> 00:04:23.389
autonomous systems on the roads
today. Tesla has been available

8febc438-38f8-4ae5-8b00-79128ab9eb8c-7
00:04:23.389 --> 00:04:26.583
in beta on its vehicles since
2015 and drivers have been known

8febc438-38f8-4ae5-8b00-79128ab9eb8c-8
00:04:26.583 --> 00:04:29.726
to use the current system hands
free. Tesla is promising full

8febc438-38f8-4ae5-8b00-79128ab9eb8c-9
00:04:29.726 --> 00:04:32.160
self driving software is just
around the corner

80e25ea7-b953-4f43-b24d-55780b58fb77-0
00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:36.366
to be tight, but it still does
appear that will be at least in

80e25ea7-b953-4f43-b24d-55780b58fb77-1
00:04:36.366 --> 00:04:39.747
limited in in early access
release of a feature complete

80e25ea7-b953-4f43-b24d-55780b58fb77-2
00:04:39.747 --> 00:04:43.484
full self-driving feature this
year. I think Tesla is actually

80e25ea7-b953-4f43-b24d-55780b58fb77-3
00:04:43.484 --> 00:04:46.806
a lot further back than they
would like the world to to

80e25ea7-b953-4f43-b24d-55780b58fb77-4
00:04:46.806 --> 00:04:50.365
believe they are because they
they are in fact so much more

80e25ea7-b953-4f43-b24d-55780b58fb77-5
00:04:50.365 --> 00:04:53.568
limited in terms of their

80e25ea7-b953-4f43-b24d-55780b58fb77-6
00:04:53.568 --> 00:04:57.067
self-driving shuttles that
operate along designated routes

80e25ea7-b953-4f43-b24d-55780b58fb77-7
00:04:57.067 --> 00:05:00.745
only or focusing on trucks with
long haul highway routes. And

80e25ea7-b953-4f43-b24d-55780b58fb77-8
00:05:00.745 --> 00:05:02.939
then there are companies like
Ghost,

3fb32ed7-c606-40f5-a72a-98fe371a9fad-0
00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:06.515
then, I working on aftermarket
kits, essentially hardware that

3fb32ed7-c606-40f5-a72a-98fe371a9fad-1
00:05:06.515 --> 00:05:10.066
could be installed in older cars
to bring them new self-driving

3fb32ed7-c606-40f5-a72a-98fe371a9fad-2
00:05:10.066 --> 00:05:13.507
capabilities one day. For all
players in this space, the path

3fb32ed7-c606-40f5-a72a-98fe371a9fad-3
00:05:13.507 --> 00:05:16.947
ahead is filled with challenges,
chief among them proving the

3fb32ed7-c606-40f5-a72a-98fe371a9fad-4
00:05:16.947 --> 00:05:20.498
technology is safe. Driverless
systems have to meet a very high

3fb32ed7-c606-40f5-a72a-98fe371a9fad-5
00:05:20.498 --> 00:05:23.883
safety bar that has to be better
than a human before they're

3fb32ed7-c606-40f5-a72a-98fe371a9fad-6
00:05:23.883 --> 00:05:27.434
deployed at scale. There are no
federally established standards

3fb32ed7-c606-40f5-a72a-98fe371a9fad-7
00:05:27.434 --> 00:05:30.653
or testing protocols for
automated driving systems in the

3fb32ed7-c606-40f5-a72a-98fe371a9fad-8
00:05:30.653 --> 00:05:33.150
US today, but there have been
fatal crashes.

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:37.114
Woman named Elaine Hertzberg was
killed by an autonomous Uber

bfc78ae4-4728-4404-a371-fd67026b8a0f-1
00:05:37.114 --> 00:05:40.690
with a safety driver who was
paying no attention. This woman

bfc78ae4-4728-4404-a371-fd67026b8a0f-2
00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:44.442
was crossing the street walking
her bicycle. Should easily have

bfc78ae4-4728-4404-a371-fd67026b8a0f-3
00:05:44.442 --> 00:05:47.842
been seen by the autonomous
vehicle was not was run over.

bfc78ae4-4728-4404-a371-fd67026b8a0f-4
00:05:47.842 --> 00:05:51.594
Nobody stepped on the brakes. In
2016, a Tesla fan named Joshua

bfc78ae4-4728-4404-a371-fd67026b8a0f-5
00:05:51.594 --> 00:05:54.995
Brown died in a crash while
using Autopilot hands free in

bfc78ae4-4728-4404-a371-fd67026b8a0f-6
00:05:54.995 --> 00:05:58.395
Florida. Other Autopilot
involved accidents are now under

bfc78ae4-4728-4404-a371-fd67026b8a0f-7
00:05:58.395 --> 00:06:01.385
investigation. Still, the
industry is hopeful that

bfc78ae4-4728-4404-a371-fd67026b8a0f-8
00:06:01.385 --> 00:06:03.730
autonomous vehicles will make
the roads

485b14b8-f55a-4a9b-80ac-bf859ca7bf3e-0
00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:07.404
far safer than they are today.
Really, the kind of 0 to one

485b14b8-f55a-4a9b-80ac-bf859ca7bf3e-1
00:06:07.404 --> 00:06:11.249
moment for the industry will be
when we can remove those safety

485b14b8-f55a-4a9b-80ac-bf859ca7bf3e-2
00:06:11.249 --> 00:06:15.094
drivers safely and the vehicle
can operate without the presence

485b14b8-f55a-4a9b-80ac-bf859ca7bf3e-3
00:06:15.094 --> 00:06:18.819
of any human. Others like Elon
Musk have said, you know, it's

485b14b8-f55a-4a9b-80ac-bf859ca7bf3e-4
00:06:18.819 --> 00:06:22.784
almost irresponsible not to have
these vehicles out there because

485b14b8-f55a-4a9b-80ac-bf859ca7bf3e-5
00:06:22.784 --> 00:06:26.629
they are safer and will be safer
than human drivers. Even if we

485b14b8-f55a-4a9b-80ac-bf859ca7bf3e-6
00:06:26.629 --> 00:06:30.294
could say that an autonomous
vehicle was better than a human

485b14b8-f55a-4a9b-80ac-bf859ca7bf3e-7
00:06:30.294 --> 00:06:33.959
driver, it doesn't mean that an
autonomous vehicle is better

485b14b8-f55a-4a9b-80ac-bf859ca7bf3e-8
00:06:33.959 --> 00:06:34.680
than a human

d85fdb16-3b1b-4d0a-b289-1e9f0345ab10-0
00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:38.418
driver. Plus all of the advanced
driver assist systems we have

d85fdb16-3b1b-4d0a-b289-1e9f0345ab10-1
00:06:38.418 --> 00:06:42.027
when looking at when the tech
could actually be ready. One of

d85fdb16-3b1b-4d0a-b289-1e9f0345ab10-2
00:06:42.027 --> 00:06:45.812
the principal metrics touted by
companies is the number of miles

d85fdb16-3b1b-4d0a-b289-1e9f0345ab10-3
00:06:45.812 --> 00:06:49.130
driven. But not all miles are
created equal when testing

d85fdb16-3b1b-4d0a-b289-1e9f0345ab10-4
00:06:49.130 --> 00:06:52.624
automated systems. You could
take an autonomous vehicle and

d85fdb16-3b1b-4d0a-b289-1e9f0345ab10-5
00:06:52.624 --> 00:06:56.059
go, you know, put it on an Oval
track, you know, or just a

d85fdb16-3b1b-4d0a-b289-1e9f0345ab10-6
00:06:56.059 --> 00:06:59.436
straight road, and you could
drive 100 million miles. But

d85fdb16-3b1b-4d0a-b289-1e9f0345ab10-7
00:06:59.436 --> 00:07:02.929
that's not really going to tell
you much about how well the

d85fdb16-3b1b-4d0a-b289-1e9f0345ab10-8
00:07:02.929 --> 00:07:06.189
system actually functions
because it's not encountering

25805cee-3464-45fc-bc71-130ee1abc18c-0
00:07:06.290 --> 00:07:09.405
the kinds of things that are
actually challenging in a

25805cee-3464-45fc-bc71-130ee1abc18c-1
00:07:09.405 --> 00:07:12.691
driving environment. Testing
self driving vehicles out on

25805cee-3464-45fc-bc71-130ee1abc18c-2
00:07:12.691 --> 00:07:16.089
public roads isn't enough. They
need to be exposed to every

25805cee-3464-45fc-bc71-130ee1abc18c-3
00:07:16.089 --> 00:07:19.318
imaginable scenario. So
companies rely on simulation. We

25805cee-3464-45fc-bc71-130ee1abc18c-4
00:07:19.318 --> 00:07:23.057
can create situations that we're
basically never going to see are

25805cee-3464-45fc-bc71-130ee1abc18c-5
00:07:23.057 --> 00:07:24.870
very rarely see. So for example,

1b659533-eeb6-4c27-85d0-d667f05ce16b-0
00:07:25.510 --> 00:07:28.601
we might want to simulate what
happens as a bicycle comes

1b659533-eeb6-4c27-85d0-d667f05ce16b-1
00:07:28.601 --> 00:07:31.958
through an intersection, runs a
red light and crashes into the

1b659533-eeb6-4c27-85d0-d667f05ce16b-2
00:07:31.958 --> 00:07:35.422
side of our car. Turns out that
doesn't happen very often in the

1b659533-eeb6-4c27-85d0-d667f05ce16b-3
00:07:35.422 --> 00:07:38.513
real world. But we want to know
that if that happens, our

1b659533-eeb6-4c27-85d0-d667f05ce16b-4
00:07:38.513 --> 00:07:41.604
vehicles are going to do
something safe. Basically, allow

1b659533-eeb6-4c27-85d0-d667f05ce16b-5
00:07:41.604 --> 00:07:44.802
the car to practise up in the
cloud instead of on the road.

1b659533-eeb6-4c27-85d0-d667f05ce16b-6
00:07:44.802 --> 00:07:48.053
When you're testing autonomous
vehicles out on public roads,

1b659533-eeb6-4c27-85d0-d667f05ce16b-7
00:07:48.053 --> 00:07:50.984
not only are the people riding
in that car part of the

1b659533-eeb6-4c27-85d0-d667f05ce16b-8
00:07:50.984 --> 00:07:54.448
experiment, but so is everybody
else around you, and they didn't

1b659533-eeb6-4c27-85d0-d667f05ce16b-9
00:07:54.448 --> 00:07:56.580
consent to being part of an
experiment.

27cfd1a6-4ab2-4979-9e92-ae4da1f550c0-0
00:07:56.860 --> 00:08:01.352
I remain concerned that humans
will be used as test dummies.

27cfd1a6-4ab2-4979-9e92-ae4da1f550c0-1
00:08:01.352 --> 00:08:05.918
Instead of self certification
and deregulation, I want to see

27cfd1a6-4ab2-4979-9e92-ae4da1f550c0-2
00:08:05.918 --> 00:08:10.263
strong independent safety
regulations from the agencies in

27cfd1a6-4ab2-4979-9e92-ae4da1f550c0-3
00:08:10.263 --> 00:08:14.608
front of us today. The self
certification approach did not

27cfd1a6-4ab2-4979-9e92-ae4da1f550c0-4
00:08:14.608 --> 00:08:19.395
work out well for the Boeing 737
Max 8, and now Boeing is paying

27cfd1a6-4ab2-4979-9e92-ae4da1f550c0-5
00:08:19.395 --> 00:08:24.035
the price. We should heed that
lesson when it comes to finding

27cfd1a6-4ab2-4979-9e92-ae4da1f550c0-6
00:08:24.035 --> 00:08:27.570
out the best way to deploy
autonomous vehicles.

e582d176-ec12-43d7-9a1e-0d0975b713c2-0
00:08:27.900 --> 00:08:31.081
Lawmakers held hearings this
month to figure out how to keep

e582d176-ec12-43d7-9a1e-0d0975b713c2-1
00:08:31.081 --> 00:08:34.471
the public safe without holding
back. Self Driving innovation In

e582d176-ec12-43d7-9a1e-0d0975b713c2-2
00:08:34.471 --> 00:08:37.704
September, the National Highway
Traffic Safety Administration

e582d176-ec12-43d7-9a1e-0d0975b713c2-3
00:08:37.704 --> 00:08:40.990
released new federal guidelines
for automated driving systems,

e582d176-ec12-43d7-9a1e-0d0975b713c2-4
00:08:40.990 --> 00:08:44.014
but their only voluntary
suggestions at this point. State

e582d176-ec12-43d7-9a1e-0d0975b713c2-5
00:08:44.014 --> 00:08:47.457
legislation is farther along. As
of October 41 states have either

e582d176-ec12-43d7-9a1e-0d0975b713c2-6
00:08:47.457 --> 00:08:50.690
enacted laws or signed executive
orders regulating autonomous

e582d176-ec12-43d7-9a1e-0d0975b713c2-7
00:08:50.690 --> 00:08:53.454
vehicles. With regulatory
questions looming, it's no

e582d176-ec12-43d7-9a1e-0d0975b713c2-8
00:08:53.454 --> 00:08:56.166
surprise that self driving
companies are proceeding

e582d176-ec12-43d7-9a1e-0d0975b713c2-9
00:08:56.166 --> 00:08:59.452
cautiously at first. What we're
going to be seeing in the next

e582d176-ec12-43d7-9a1e-0d0975b713c2-10
00:08:59.452 --> 00:09:00.129
several years

0a8ee7f9-a09d-4c8a-b512-50d069be0299-0
00:09:00.230 --> 00:09:03.540
is more limited deployments in
very specific areas where

0a8ee7f9-a09d-4c8a-b512-50d069be0299-1
00:09:03.540 --> 00:09:06.851
there's confidence that the
technology can work. I think

0a8ee7f9-a09d-4c8a-b512-50d069be0299-2
00:09:06.851 --> 00:09:10.453
we'll see limited deployments of
self driving vehicles in the

0a8ee7f9-a09d-4c8a-b512-50d069be0299-3
00:09:10.453 --> 00:09:13.764
next five years or so. You'll
see these moving goods and

0a8ee7f9-a09d-4c8a-b512-50d069be0299-4
00:09:13.764 --> 00:09:17.481
you'll see them moving people,
but you'll see them specifically

0a8ee7f9-a09d-4c8a-b512-50d069be0299-5
00:09:17.481 --> 00:09:20.734
in fleet applications. Aurora
says its systems could be

0a8ee7f9-a09d-4c8a-b512-50d069be0299-6
00:09:20.734 --> 00:09:24.336
integrated into any vehicle from
fleets of taxis to long haul

0a8ee7f9-a09d-4c8a-b512-50d069be0299-7
00:09:24.336 --> 00:09:28.053
trucks. The cost of self driving
technology is another deciding

0a8ee7f9-a09d-4c8a-b512-50d069be0299-8
00:09:28.053 --> 00:09:30.900
factor for how it'll be
deployed. Most consumers

8440d136-c677-4125-8610-44091db7d96c-0
00:09:30.970 --> 00:09:34.588
are never going to own a vehicle
that's really autonomous because

8440d136-c677-4125-8610-44091db7d96c-1
00:09:34.588 --> 00:09:38.097
the technology is expensive and
there's there's a whole raft of

8440d136-c677-4125-8610-44091db7d96c-2
00:09:38.097 --> 00:09:41.552
issues around product liability
and you know, making sure that

8440d136-c677-4125-8610-44091db7d96c-3
00:09:41.552 --> 00:09:44.842
it's properly maintained and
sensors are calibrated. That's

8440d136-c677-4125-8610-44091db7d96c-4
00:09:44.842 --> 00:09:47.693
one reason ride hailing
companies Lyft and Uber are

8440d136-c677-4125-8610-44091db7d96c-5
00:09:47.693 --> 00:09:51.202
getting in the game. We have two
autonomous initiatives. One is

8440d136-c677-4125-8610-44091db7d96c-6
00:09:51.202 --> 00:09:54.602
the open platform where we're
connecting lift passengers with

8440d136-c677-4125-8610-44091db7d96c-7
00:09:54.602 --> 00:09:57.727
our partner self driving
vehicles. And so this is active

8440d136-c677-4125-8610-44091db7d96c-8
00:09:57.727 --> 00:10:00.962
in Las Vegas and Waymo in
Chandler, AZ. And then also kind

8440d136-c677-4125-8610-44091db7d96c-9

experience for the tech that you
see here, which is Level 5. As

00:10:05.537 --> 00:10:09.100
AV companies inched toward the
mainstream public perception,

d2de11b3-fc06-4b81-9787-b9958f1cda87-2
00:10:09.100 --> 00:10:12.779
simple understanding of the tech
has become another issue that

d2de11b3-fc06-4b81-9787-b9958f1cda87-3
00:10:12.779 --> 00:10:16.458
could impact progress. Some in
particular in the industry have

d2de11b3-fc06-4b81-9787-b9958f1cda87-4
00:10:16.458 --> 00:10:19.670
have done a disservice to the
public in overhyping the

d2de11b3-fc06-4b81-9787-b9958f1cda87-5
00:10:19.670 --> 00:10:23.349
technology before it's really
ready. It's still not very clear

d2de11b3-fc06-4b81-9787-b9958f1cda87-6
00:10:23.349 --> 00:10:27.028
to most people what we mean when
we say driverless cars. Waymo

d2de11b3-fc06-4b81-9787-b9958f1cda87-7
00:10:27.028 --> 00:10:30.240
and General Motors Cruise
Automation are very close to

d2de11b3-fc06-4b81-9787-b9958f1cda87-8
00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:32.460
having what they referred to as
level

51cfecaa-55a5-4c0b-b7e1-eb6e5a9a83d7-0
00:10:32.530 --> 00:10:37.566
five cars most of the time. In
other words, again they can in

51cfecaa-55a5-4c0b-b7e1-eb6e5a9a83d7-1
00:10:37.566 --> 00:10:40.410
theory function all by
themselves,

fa0db266-a05c-43e6-957d-954bb3263b3f-0
00:10:41.290 --> 00:10:44.470
but so far it seems that they
function like a, you know, a 15

fa0db266-a05c-43e6-957d-954bb3263b3f-1
00:10:44.470 --> 00:10:47.753
year old driver hoping to get a
driver's licence. There's a lot

fa0db266-a05c-43e6-957d-954bb3263b3f-2
00:10:47.753 --> 00:10:51.036
of people who think that you can
buy autonomous vehicles today.

fa0db266-a05c-43e6-957d-954bb3263b3f-3
00:10:51.036 --> 00:10:54.267
You know, especially when you
can go out and buy a car and buy

fa0db266-a05c-43e6-957d-954bb3263b3f-4
00:10:54.267 --> 00:10:57.396
an option that's that's called
full self-driving and pay for

fa0db266-a05c-43e6-957d-954bb3263b3f-5
00:10:57.396 --> 00:11:00.371
that. You expect that it
actually exists and the the fact

fa0db266-a05c-43e6-957d-954bb3263b3f-6
00:11:00.371 --> 00:11:03.500
is it does not exist today. With
an uncertain timeline and a

fa0db266-a05c-43e6-957d-954bb3263b3f-7
00:11:03.500 --> 00:11:06.578
history of missed targets,
public confusion is no surprise.

fa0db266-a05c-43e6-957d-954bb3263b3f-8
00:11:06.578 --> 00:11:09.861
Despite big developments, most
companies have recognised we are

fa0db266-a05c-43e6-957d-954bb3263b3f-9
00:11:09.861 --> 00:11:12.579
still years away from having
truly self driving cars

4c13f652-058b-443b-b71f-d1face3e8c27-0
00:11:12.650 --> 00:11:16.637
as part of our daily lives. One
big question is one is the car

4c13f652-058b-443b-b71f-d1face3e8c27-1
00:11:16.637 --> 00:11:20.499
ready? You have to have a good
sense of all of the scenarios

4c13f652-058b-443b-b71f-d1face3e8c27-2
00:11:20.499 --> 00:11:24.043
and all of the situations that
the vehicle will need to

4c13f652-058b-443b-b71f-d1face3e8c27-3
00:11:24.043 --> 00:11:28.031
encounter and that just takes
time. We expect level 4 vehicles

4c13f652-058b-443b-b71f-d1face3e8c27-4
00:11:28.031 --> 00:11:31.576
to be feasible in small
quantities within the next five

4c13f652-058b-443b-b71f-d1face3e8c27-5
00:11:31.576 --> 00:11:35.437
years and what that means is
you'll probably see hundreds or

4c13f652-058b-443b-b71f-d1face3e8c27-6
00:11:35.437 --> 00:11:39.361
maybe thousands of vehicles out
either delivering packages or

4c13f652-058b-443b-b71f-d1face3e8c27-7
00:11:39.361 --> 00:11:42.526
moving people's through
neighbourhood or or maybe

4c13f652-058b-443b-b71f-d1face3e8c27-8
00:11:42.526 --> 00:11:42.970
hauling

ac3bcb29-73dc-4a5d-af6e-90d6a134bb5d-0
00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:46.603
goods on our freeways. And now
even the experts hesitate to

ac3bcb29-73dc-4a5d-af6e-90d6a134bb5d-1
00:11:46.603 --> 00:11:50.107
make promises on when true self
driving will get here. You

ac3bcb29-73dc-4a5d-af6e-90d6a134bb5d-2
00:11:50.107 --> 00:11:53.789
always have to assume that the
user is going to find a way to

ac3bcb29-73dc-4a5d-af6e-90d6a134bb5d-3
00:11:53.789 --> 00:11:57.352
misuse the technology, assume
the worst and then design for

ac3bcb29-73dc-4a5d-af6e-90d6a134bb5d-4
00:11:57.352 --> 00:12:01.212
that. I think it's a mistake to
be over promoting the technology

ac3bcb29-73dc-4a5d-af6e-90d6a134bb5d-5
00:12:01.212 --> 00:12:04.538
and overhyping it when it's
still a very much a work in

ac3bcb29-73dc-4a5d-af6e-90d6a134bb5d-6
00:12:04.538 --> 00:12:08.160
progress. This is something we
need to do with society, with

ac3bcb29-73dc-4a5d-af6e-90d6a134bb5d-7
00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:11.486
the community and not our
society and we take that very

ac3bcb29-73dc-4a5d-af6e-90d6a134bb5d-8
00:12:11.486 --> 00:12:14.040
seriously. We're building
mission critical

00:12:14.110 --> 00:12:16.914
50 systems that are going to
have a huge positive impact on

b8c4d6cb-57c7-4301-a340-42d45f6eb330-1
00:12:16.914 --> 00:12:19.625
people's lives, and the tech
adage of move fast and break

00:12:19.625 --> 00:12:22.570
things most assuredly does not
apply to what we're doing here.
