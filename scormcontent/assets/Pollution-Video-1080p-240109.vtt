00:00:00.115 --> 00:00:03.769
There is a rising
concern about health problems in Europe,

00:00:03.769 --> 00:00:05.884
the USA in emerging countries

00:00:05.884 --> 00:00:10.000
due to carbon emissions
from a rapidly growing fleet of cars.

00:00:10.038 --> 00:00:12.653
The problem can clearly be seen
if one considers

00:00:12.653 --> 00:00:16.384
the enormous growth in car ownership
and car density.

00:00:16.461 --> 00:00:19.692
Moreover,
if one looks at the concentrations of cars

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:24.000
in Asia, for example,
where the largest concentrations of cars

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.769
are mostly in large cities
with growth rates of more than 15%,

00:00:28.846 --> 00:00:32.384
the seriousness of the situation
becomes clear.

00:00:32.461 --> 00:00:36.000
The metropolitan areas in crowded
Asian countries

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.846
are suffering from an increasing pollution
load of small particles.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.730
The smoke in China's capital,
Beijing, has become infamous

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:48.076
with a rise in particulates,
especially during the winter season.

00:00:48.076 --> 00:00:51.769
From November to April,
where heating is being used.

00:00:51.846 --> 00:00:55.884
Indian cities
such as Delhi, Mumbai and Bangalore

00:00:56.038 --> 00:01:00.576
also suffer
from severe traffic congestion and smoke.

00:01:00.653 --> 00:01:02.500
The danger to the health of citizens

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:06.538
is now well documented
and can no longer be ignored.

00:01:06.615 --> 00:01:11.730
China already has enforced electrical
propulsion for two wheelers in cities.

00:01:11.807 --> 00:01:14.769
Other countries will follow also.

00:01:14.769 --> 00:01:17.538
Many second and third tier cities in India

00:01:17.538 --> 00:01:20.692
are suffering from high pollution
due to vehicle emissions.
