00:00:00.461 --> 00:00:04.115
The share of EVs or electric vehicles.

00:00:04.115 --> 00:00:08.500
Among the total number of cars rose to 76

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:12.384
per 10,000 in the EU in 2021,

00:00:12.461 --> 00:00:16.884
from only two per 10,000 in 2013.

00:00:17.038 --> 00:00:19.461
All these figures
shows the time of a sea change

00:00:19.461 --> 00:00:23.153
in the automotive sector in Europe,

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:25.000
but the number of vehicles

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.461
of eligible vehicles is still small.

00:00:28.538 --> 00:00:31.769
Some countries,
such as Norway, have taken the lead.

00:00:31.846 --> 00:00:34.500
But in Germany, for example,
actual sales seem

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.846
like behind the original plans
and projection.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.230
This is due for several reasons.

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.346
Most importantly, the cost of the vehicle

00:00:43.346 --> 00:00:47.230
with the battery
as the primary cost driver, inadequate

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:52.884
charging infrastructure,
limited range and time needed for charging

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
without an adequate charging
infrastructure.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
Sales of electric vehicles
will remain slow,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.500
and without enough vehicles on the road,
there is no incentive

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:06.538
for investors to provide an adequate
charging infrastructure.

00:01:06.615 --> 00:01:09.384
The same holds true for battery prices.

00:01:09.384 --> 00:01:13.461
They remain high when only a few electric
cars are being sold

00:01:13.538 --> 00:01:19.730
and the high battery prices in turn affect
the attractiveness of electric cars.

00:01:19.807 --> 00:01:23.192
Another factor which slows down,
which slows down,

00:01:23.192 --> 00:01:28.192
is the market penetration of electric
cars, is the competing charging standards.

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:33.346
In Europe, there are at least three
infrastructure standards of fast charging.
